    abstract = {This work is an extension of an axis-crossing algorithm to compute winding number for solving point in polygon for an arbitary polygon. Polygons are popular drawings in computer graphics to represent different types of structures with approximations. Solutions for point-in-polygons are many, like even-odd rule, positive-negative number, and winding number. This paper mainly deals with improvements of ‘A winding number and point in polygon algorithm’. Point in polygon is a fundamental problem and has various applications in ray tracing, computer graphics, image processing, gaming applications, robotics, acoustics, geo-science etc. The main focus of this paper explains about winding number for a closed polygon ‘S’, to test whether point ‘P’ lies either inside or outside with respect to positive and negative axis-crossing algorithm method.}
